60 Minute Soho is a tour company operating in Soho, London. The company offers a selection of walking tours in the area, each tour exploring a different theme.

### Fonts

<img width="1159" alt="60-minute-soho__Fredoka" src="https://github.com/AlexBishopCode/60-Minute-Soho/assets/171177957/79ff2699-22e0-45eb-9161-053956cd2d3c">

- The main logo uses the font 'Fredoka'. This font was chosen for the logo after some research into font stylings that draw inspiration from the 1960s - an era heavily associated with Soho and Carnaby Street.
- The logo is a big, round and friendly font that is also bold and simple in design. This choice of font means the the logo always stands out, crearing contrast against the simplistic styling of the secondary font.
- It seemed appropriate to use this font as it can immiediately be associated with the history of the area which in turn is immediately relevant due to the historical themes explored within the walking tours.
- The secondary font is 'Roboto', a sens-serif font. The font is simple and creates a frictionless reading experiene. The simplicity of the font creased a nice contrast to the 'Fredoka' logo font and ensures all information on the web page is clear and easy to read. A mixture of bold, italic and light variants of the 'Roboto' font have been used to create contrast between headers and paragraphs.

### Icons

- The above icons from the 'Fontawesome' Icon library have been utilised as classes in the i tag.
- The icons have been styled cohesively with the overarching color palette.
- Icons present within the accesssibility section of the web page are displayed in a blue (#2E2999) color as this color is believed to encourage a perception of trust.
- Social media icons have been positioned within the web page footer. By utilising the 'a' tag these icons have associated hyperlinks. Now the user can identify the speicifc social media platform based on their iconic logo and access the hyperlink immediately with one click. 

### Colors

With the user and business goals in mind, it was important for this site to have a minimalist color pallete. The color palette needs to appear professional, complement the content to make it clear and easy-to-read whilst also ensuring that the page has character.

![Image of the site color palette](assets/documents/readme-images/readme-coolors.png)


- 'Dun' #DCD0B6 - This gentle color is used the provide character and to distinguish between sections of the web page, mirroring the building walls on the hero image ensures the page feels familiar for the full length of the web page. The color along-side the hero image is intended to evoke imagery of an urban area such as Soho.
- 'Whitesmoke' #F5F5F5 - A comfortbale off-white. This color provides a perfect canvas for bold easy-to-read text on large sections of the website whilst also providing more character than a stark bright white.
- 'Jet #323232 - A dusty shade of black. This color has been used to add an element of sophistication to the font color on the website. Thus variation of black suggests age and mystery, reflecting the nature of the walking tours. This color is chosen for our font-styles to stand out on a pale background.
- 'International Klein Blue' #2E2999 - A deep blue which is sure to stand out against a pale background color. The blue has been used for icons and some text to emphasise trust and responsibility, designed to make the user feel at ease about using the service.


### Images

A full-quality hero image (displayed below) is utilised at the top of the page so the user immediatley understands that the service provided operates in Soho. The hero image is taken on a day with blue skies to appear friendly and welcoming to the user which helps to influence user engagement.

The three images (displayed below) utilised within the tours section were chosen due to their association with each of the themed walks. This is to provide the user with a small glimpse into the kinds of things they will encounter on that specific tour.

#### BUGS

##### Existing Bugs
- The hero image does not fully cover the hero div on some specific screen sizes when tested.
- The navigation bar remains open after use which blocks the users view of the content when you ustilise the navigation bar until it is manually closed.

##### Fixed Bugs
- The fixed (sticky) navigation bar at the top of the page was covering sections of text when utilised so the associated sections of the site you were expecting to navigate to appeared muddled and unclear. This was fixed by adding a hidden div above each section the same height of the nav bar and linking the nav bar to the hidden div in order for the user to see the full content of the section they wished to view.
- The booking form loaded an error message once details had been entered saying the page visited was not secure. This was due to a typo in the target="" where https:// was written as http://.
- Accessibility performance failed in testing due to a lack of contract between a previous blue utilised for font-color on the site. After changing blue to a darker blue the accessibility rating checked provided a successful score of 100.
